- Second day of having the new computer. Life is going on, as normally as ever. Arch is really fun to work with. Kmonad is teriffic but occasionally annoying. Pressing ctrl-w to close the whole window is a terrible mistake to make and kind of a pain in the ass.
- My battery isn't charging?
- God logseq takes forever to load. What is up with Electron? And why can't I get it to save my configuration for the dark theme? These are the questions that will never be answered in our lifetime.
- Other news - VSCode seems to be working more or less ok, as is just about everything else (assuming i3wm is no longer hanging on stuff, which seems... hopeful.)
