- STL update: Sent off the new STLs to Tom Bolland, with revised battery holder, DC motor holder, and a new jig. #starscouts
	- Also asked about laser cutting parts.
- Matlib progress: I absolutely *must* send an email today with the progress of matlib. It's the 20th, I haven't heard anything from the old supervisors in ages; it's about time. Also many of the item pages will be impossible to further flesh out without feedback from the instructors.
