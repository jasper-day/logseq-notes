- Starscout tolerance fixes and updates: #starscouts
	- DONE Nosecone base: printed 53.17, desired 54, redesign + 0.6mm diam
	- DC motor mount: take mounting diameter to 50mm (same with small DC motor mount)
	- DONE Aft bulkhead: remove 3D printed part, hole is ok for M6 (is this what you wanted?) and outer diameter increase to 54.2 mm
	- DONE Laser ply is 6 +- 0.05 mm, easily set all cuts to hold 6 rather than 6.5
	- DONE Remove 0.5 mm from inner diameter of all laser cut rings (0.5mm smaller)
	- DONE Add 1 mm to outer diameter of all laser cut rings (take to 54.5mm)
	- Redo jigs to fit 3mm base (and laser cut a new jig for the fins?)
	- DONE Add 0.4 mm to the outside of the fwd bh (center hole is fine)
	- DONE Fix mounting surfaces of fins on rings (take everything to say 5.8mm, make the stuff flush)
	- DONE Think about 3 fins vs 4
