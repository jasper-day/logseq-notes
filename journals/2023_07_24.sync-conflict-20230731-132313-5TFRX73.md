- It is monday - the start to a whole brand new week!
- Goals for today:
	- We will be going to UCreate later. I would like to run off a new batch of laser cut parts. Everything besides the fin can, which we already have enough of. There are also new things to 3D print, and a new nosecone design to make.
	- Motor centering ring (and new motor retention design) - 4x each part
	- Fins - do this later
	- Fin jig (possibly cut this out of the shitty cheap plywood)
	- Rethink the small DC motor mount,
		- go pick up the steel sheet later
		- ask g20 about cutting 0.5 mil steel (think we can do this)
	- Redesign fins with triple centering ring, I feel like it could use them
	- Better fin cutting jig? think about flattening the ends as well. God, perpendicularity is *so hard*
	- Search container again for eye bolts (rotten stinkers), think about moving to m4
	- Spray paints
	- At ucreate today: assembling at least one fin assembly, with all laser cut parts.
