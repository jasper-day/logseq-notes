- ### [[Apple User Experience Guidelines]] #matlib
  id:: 64bf8b84-8702-428e-a159-1d141fb3ad11
	- **User experience testing**
		- Introduce, describe, make it clear that you are testing the product
		- Tell the user how long the test will take, what they will be doing, what the materials are, and the sequence in which they will use them.
		- Use "think-aloud" protocol: as participants work, say what comes to mind
			- Expectations
			- Intentions
			- Problem-solving strategies
		- Watch for patterns
	- **Costs of adding new features**
		- Application gets larger, slower, more complex
		- Documentation and help become more extensive
		- Spend time developing new features rather than refining old ones - which would improve the core experience
	- Aim for 80% solution: design the software to meet the needs of at least 80% of the users.
	- **Ease of use**
		- Use concrete, familiar, *obvious* metaphors
		- Focus on *solutions* not features
		- Avoid overwhelming users by presenting too much information at once.
		- Make application accessible to people with disabilities
		- Provide appropriate documentation (to developers and users)
		- *Reflect the user's mental model*
			- Familiar, simple, *discoverable*
	- **Consistency**
		- Same terms and icons for labels and features
		- Concepts presented in similar ways across all pages
		- Should be easy to achieve with templating
	- Feature tree:
		- **Minimum features**
			- Present text and images
			- Catalogue items
		- **Expected features**
			- High performance
		- **Differentiation**
			- Surprise and delight - by delivering more of *what people want*, and delivering it faster.
