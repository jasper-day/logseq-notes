  SCHEDULED: <2023-08-08 Tue>
- News for today - back at work for the first time.
- Changes for matlib #matlib
	- Learn how to git branch and push the content to a new branch, then merge it in
	- Set up local dev environment? It seemed pretty difficult the last time I did it, but maybe using WSL and Docker it could be a little easier (or using Docker on this computer.)
