- It's Klobbering time!
- Came up with a great new idea for the website. #matlib
	- *Item organization*.
		- The pages for "materials" and "processes" should be entry points to the **items**.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Items should expose as much **relevant** information about themselves as possible.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- If we don't know something about an item, we should say it!
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Kmonad is working ok but I have to figure out why sticky-keys keeps giving me double inputs for shift.
