	- This can't be done as there are no free shelves to place books on.
	- LATER [#C] Go to the library

- **Goals**:
	- Better time management.
		- This should be both **long term and short term**. I want to be able to manage what I've done throughout the day, what I *will* do throughout the rest of the day, and what I will do for the coming week / month / year.
- **Notes about LogSeq**:
	- I'm kind of liking the default-bulleted-list "everything is a referenceable block" kind of approach.
	- Normally not having a great vim-like experience would kind of suck, but honestly it works fine because 99% of the time I'm using cmk-extend to do simple editing things, and the rest of the time the vim plugin should be good enough (for, say, navigation).
	- Time will tell whether this is going to be good enough for stuff. So far it basically feels like Obsidian daily notes, but maybe worse. I want to figure out how to make an agenda with it.
	- There's no right-click menu?
